## Description

This is a memory testing game that shuffles pokemon with every pick. It is there to test how good your memory is with a timer to also see how long you too.
I used setTimeout to do the count down.

# Difficulties

All there there was no difficulties with this. It was simply to but the logic try was very confusing at first. It took a bit longer than I initially thought. It boosted my understanding of useEffect and useState.
I am much more confident in my implimentation of both and reckon I am much more able to do.
